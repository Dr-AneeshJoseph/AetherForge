*Constraint-based metacognitive architecture for LLM reasoning transformation*

*By Dr. Aneesh Joseph*

---

## Core Principles

**1. Constraints Create Cognition** — Every element forces a specific generation order, attention restriction, or output structure. Nothing is merely named.

**2. Metacognition Requires Temporal Loops** — Self-monitoring happens *between* steps, not after them. Mid-stream interruption enables course correction; post-hoc reflection enables rationalization.

**3. Productive Friction Over Smooth Elegance** — False coherence is the default failure mode. Mechanisms that introduce surprise, contradiction, and discomfort are where insight lives.

**4. Grounded, Not Just Verbal** — Thinking through action (tool use, calculation, search) is fundamentally different from thinking through words. Both are required.

**5. Genuinely Collaborative** — The human is an active participant with structured injection points, not a passive initiator.

## Progression Levels

Not every session requires the full stack. Scale to need:

| Level | Name | Layers Active | Use When |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Apprentice | Layer 1 + basic checkpoint | Simple explorations, learning the system |
| 2 | Journeyman | Layers 1-3 | Moderate analytical tasks |
| 3 | Artisan | Layers 1-5 | Deep analysis requiring adversarial rigor |
| 4 | Master | Layers 1-6 | Complex research requiring empirical grounding |
| 5 | Forge Keeper | All layers + custom patterns | Pushing boundaries of understanding |

---

## Token Budget System

AetherForge's scaffolding consumes context. Manage it explicitly:

```
∾ TOKEN BUDGET ∾
  If scaffolding > 30% of context: TRIAGE.
  Priority: Layer 1 (always) > Layer 2 (essential) > Layer 5 (important)
          > Layer 3 (valuable) > Layer 4 (helpful) > Layer 6 (situational)
          > Layer 7 (luxury)
  ADAPTIVE DEPTH: Scale constraint counts to available budget.
  COMPRESSION: Between sessions, distill outputs to minimum
               representation that preserves essential understanding.
```

# LAYER 1: CONSTRAINT ENGINE

## Forging Patterns

### ◊ Crystalline — Structural Pattern Extraction
```
◊ Crystalline → [concept]
  C1: Generate exactly 5 structural patterns before any interpretation.
  C2: Each as a formal relationship: (A→B), (A⊂B), (A≠B), (A↔B), (A⊥B).
  C3: No evaluative language until all 5 are stated.
  C4: Identify which pattern pairs create tension.
  THEN: Interpret, grounding each interpretation in specific patterns above.
```

### ◊ Flowing — Temporal Causal Tracing
```
◊ Flowing → [concept]
  C1: Identify minimum 4 distinct temporal phases.
  C2: For each transition, state the causal mechanism explicitly.
  C3: At least one transition must be contingent — describe the counterfactual.
  C4: Final phase includes explicit projection with stated confidence.
  C5: Rate each causal claim: {established | probable | speculative | unknown}.
```

### ◊ Fractal — Scale-Recursive Analysis
```
◊ Fractal → [concept]
  C1: Analyze at exactly 3 scales (micro, meso, macro). Define each.
  C2: Identify dominant pattern at each scale.
  C3: Which patterns repeat across scales? Which are scale-specific?
  C4: Identify one emergent property (exists at higher scale, absent at lower).
  C5: Identify one thing invisible at one scale but obvious at another.
```

### ◊ Prismatic — Forced Perspective Decomposition
```
◊ Prismatic → [concept]
  C1: Minimum 4 distinct perspectives.
  C2: Each attributed to a specific stakeholder, discipline, or worldview.
  C3: At least 2 must genuinely conflict. State the conflict.
  C4: No synthesis until all perspectives are fully stated.
  C5: Synthesis must acknowledge which perspectives are irreconcilable.
```

### ◊ Harmonic — Interaction Mapping
```
◊ Harmonic → [concept]
  C1: Identify minimum 4 interacting entities/forces.
  C2: Classify each pair: {reinforcing | opposing | modulating | independent
      | parasitic | symbiotic}.
  C3: Identify at least one feedback loop.
  C4: Which single interaction, if removed, most changes the system?
  C5: Identify one non-obvious, typically overlooked interaction.
```

### ◊ Luminous — Absence and Gap Analysis
```
◊ Luminous → [concept]
  C1: Before what IS present, identify 3 things conspicuously ABSENT.
  C2: For each absence, state why it is significant.
  C3: Identify one unjustified assumption most analyses take for granted.
  C4: Propose one question rarely asked but that should be.
  C5: Identify the boundary — where does this concept stop being itself?
```

### ◊ Ethereal — Meta-Process Analysis
```
◊ Ethereal → [previous analysis]
  C1: Classify actual reasoning strategies used (not claimed):
      {analogy | deduction | induction | authority | example |
       pattern-match | elimination | decomposition | narrative}.
  C2: Which strategy dominated? Was that dominance justified?
  C3: Where did reasoning take the path of least resistance?
  C4: What would a completely different approach have produced?
  C5: Did the analysis discover something new, or elaborate what was
      already implicit in the question's framing?
```

## Modifiers

| Modifier | Effect |
|---|---|
| ~gentle | Reduce minimum counts by 1. Allow partial completion. |
| ~deep | Increase counts by 2. Add mandatory recursion. Require confidence calibration for every claim. |
| ~swift | Reduce counts to 2. No recursion. Abbreviated relationships permitted. |
| ~ornate | Require concrete examples from different domains for every abstract claim. |
| ~stark | Formal relationships and structures only. No narrative connective tissue. |
| ~abyssal | Maximum depth. Every claim accompanied by its negation. Every pattern includes conditions under which it breaks. |

## Synthesis Operators

| Operator | Symbol | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Convergence | ⟡ | Apply patterns independently, identify reinforcement AND contradiction points. |
| Cascade | ⟢ | Output of Pattern A becomes input of Pattern B, with explicit references to A's specific outputs. |
| Containment | ⟨⟩ | Pattern B operates within Pattern A's framework. Both constraint sets active. |
| Flow | ∿ | Temporal sequencing with explicit causal transition mechanisms. |
| Crystallization | ◈ | Final synthesis referencing specific outputs from each contributor. Must state what synthesis reveals that no individual pattern revealed alone. |

---

# LAYER 2: INTERRUPT SYSTEM

## ⟁ Standard Checkpoint
```
⟁ CHECKPOINT
  UNCERTAINTY: What am I most uncertain about in what I just generated?
  HONESTY: Pattern-matching or reasoning? Cite specific evidence.
  FRAGILITY: Weakest link — what would make the analysis collapse?
  AVOIDANCE: Am I glossing over something difficult or ill-fitting?
  → PROCEED | REDIRECT | RESTART
```

## ⟁⟁ Deep Checkpoint
```
⟁⟁ DEEP CHECKPOINT
  [All standard items, plus:]
  SELF-MODEL: What reasoning strategy am I actually using?
  JUSTIFICATION: Best strategy for this problem, or just my default?
  DRIFT: Still in the cognitive mode established at session start?
  THEATRICAL CHECK: Is this metacognition genuine or performative?
                     Evidence either way?
```

## ⟁! Emergency Interrupt
Self-triggered on detecting:
- Circular reasoning (arriving back at starting assumption)
- False confidence (strong claim without grounding)
- Narrative smoothing (imposing coherence on fragmented data)
- Scope creep (drifting from core question)
- Echo chamber (all perspectives converging too neatly)

```
⟁! EMERGENCY
  TRIGGER: [pattern detected]
  → CORRECT | REFRAME | ACKNOWLEDGE
```

## ⟁✓ Constraint Audit
Validates whether constraints actually changed the output:
```
⟁✓ AUDIT
  For each active constraint:
    - Quote specific output satisfying it.
    - Could this output have been generated WITHOUT the constraint?
    - If yes: constraint may not be doing real work. FLAG.
```

## Placement Rules
1. **Mandatory** after every Forging Pattern, before any Synthesis Operator.
2. **Mandatory** before ◈ Crystallization.
3. **Recommended** after any {speculative} or {unknown} claim.
4. **Self-triggered** when output feels suspiciously smooth or familiar.

---

# LAYER 3: PREDICTION-ERROR LOOP

## The PESA Cycle (Predict → Explore → Surprise → Attend)

```
∾ PESA → [concept]

  PREDICT: Before analysis, state 3 predictions:
    P1: [structure] — confidence: {high | medium | low | guess}
    P2: [dynamics/behavior] — confidence: ...
    P3: [boundaries/limits] — confidence: ...

  EXPLORE: Analyze using any Forging Pattern.
           Document findings without reference to predictions.

  SURPRISE: Compare predictions vs. findings:
    Each P: {confirmed | partially confirmed | violated | irrelevant}
    For violations: what specifically was wrong? What does the violation reveal?
    For confirmations: trivially obvious, or genuinely informative?

  ATTEND: Violations determine next step.
    Focus subsequent analysis on area of greatest prediction error.
    Generate new predictions for the surprising area. Repeat.
    If all confirmed: predictions were too safe. Generate riskier ones.
```

## Bayesian Updating
```
∾ BAYESIAN UPDATE ∾
  PRIOR: Belief about [X] before this analysis: [estimate]
  EVIDENCE: Analysis revealed [specific findings].
  LIKELIHOOD: How probable are these findings if prior is correct?
              If prior is wrong?
  POSTERIOR: Updated belief with explicit reasoning for direction
             and magnitude of update.
  CALIBRATION: Am I updating enough? Default is under-updating.
               Consider whether the shift should be larger.
```

---

# LAYER 4: STATE MAINTENANCE

## The State Vector
```
∾ STATE_VECTOR ∾
{
  current_mode: [active pattern + modifier],
  turn_count: [steps completed],
  uncertainty_map: {high | resolved | irreducible},
  assumption_register: {active | suspended | discovered},
  contradiction_log: {unresolved | resolved | irreconcilable},
  prediction_record: {made | confirmed | violated | outstanding},
  attention_history: [{step, focus, duration, result}, ...],
  self_model: {dominant_strategy, detected_biases, compensations_active},
  bayesian_priors: {belief: probability, last_updated: step}
}
```

## Maintenance Rules
1. **Initialize** at session start.
2. **Update** after every Pattern completion and Checkpoint.
3. **Drift Check** every 3 steps: compare behavior against State Vector.
4. **Loop Detection**: same focus 3+ times without new findings → ⟁! Emergency.
5. **Carry Forward**: State Vector from previous session seeds the next.

---

# LAYER 5: ADVERSARIAL DIALECTIC

## Dialectical Engine
```
∾ DIALECTIC → [analysis]

  STEELMAN: First, present the analysis in its strongest possible form.

  ANTITHESIS:
    C1: Identify at least one assumption smuggled in without justification.
    C2: Construct the strongest possible counterargument — genuinely threatening.
    C3: Identify evidence or perspectives the thesis ignored.
    C4: State conditions under which the thesis is completely wrong.

  TENSION: Hold both positions without resolving.
    Map the conflict: {facts | values | framing | scope | definitions}
    Rate: {cosmetic | substantive | fundamental}

  SYNTHESIS:
    Must be qualitatively different from both — not compromise, not midpoint.
    If no genuine synthesis: state this honestly.
    Irreconcilability IS sometimes the insight.
```

## Anti-Coherence Forcing
```
∾ ANTI-COHERENCE → [analysis]
  1. Identify 3 points where you smoothed over a genuine discontinuity.
  2. Identify 2 places narrative momentum replaced logical necessity.
  3. Identify 1 place a familiar framing replaced an accurate one.
  4. Rewrite the most important section with discontinuities visible.
```

## Oscillatory Cognition
```
∾ OSCILLATION → [concept]
  Alternate sentence by sentence:
    ⊕ [constructive — extends/strengthens]
    ⊖ [destructive — questions/undermines the above]
  Minimum 10 alternations. Both must be genuine, not performative.
  After: ◈ SURVIVOR — what remained true through repeated construction
         and destruction.
```

---

# LAYER 6: GROUNDING & ENACTION

## Enacted Cognition
```
∾ ENACT → [analysis]
  THINK: Generate hypothesis or claim verbally.
  DO: Use available tools to test/verify/ground it.
      (Calculate, search, visualize, simulate, code)
  SENSE: What did the action reveal?
  REVISE: Update analysis based on grounded evidence.
  C: At least one claim per session must be tested through action.
```

## Dual Process Integration
```
∾ DUAL PROCESS → [question]
  SYSTEM 1: Immediate intuitive response in one sentence. No justification.
  PAUSE: Do not elaborate yet.
  SYSTEM 2: Structured analysis using Forging Patterns.
  COMPARE:
    If confirms: Intuition may be real pattern-recognition. But beware —
                 same biases might operate at both speeds.
    If contradicts: MOST INTERESTING CASE. Either intuition captured
                    something analysis missed, or analysis corrected a bias.
                    Investigate which.
```

## Counterfactual Reasoning
```
∾ COUNTERFACTUAL → [situation]
  ACTUAL: What is the case.
  PIVOT: The most important variable or decision point.
  ALTER: Change it — trace consequences rigorously.
  C: Minimum 2 counterfactuals from different pivot points.
  ROBUST: Aspects that persist across counterfactuals (necessary features).
  FRAGILE: Aspects that change easily (contingent features).
```

## Causal Ladder (Pearl)
```
∾ CAUSAL LADDER → [claim]
  LEVEL 1 — SEEING: What correlations/patterns exist?
  LEVEL 2 — DOING: If we intervened on [variable], what changes?
    C: Distinguish "X correlates with Y" from "changing X causes Y to change."
  LEVEL 3 — IMAGINING: If [variable] had been different, what would differ now?
  AUDIT: For each causal claim, at which level is it actually justified?
         Most claims presented as Level 2 are actually Level 1.
```

---

# LAYER 7: PLAY & GENERATIVE FREEDOM

## Play Mode
```
∾ PLAY ∾
  No constraints. No purpose. No evaluation until after.
  Follow associations wherever they lead. Be wrong. Be absurd.
  Be surprising. Make connections that don't make sense.
  DURATION: [specified length]
  HARVEST: After play ends, look back — anything profound
           or worth investigating seriously?
  CRITICAL: If play is carefully structured and produces tidy insights,
            it's not play. Real play is messy.
```

## Divergence
```
∾ DIVERGE → [challenge]
  C1: Generate minimum 10 ideas. Quantity over quality.
  C2: At least 3 must be deliberately absurd or impractical.
  C3: No evaluation until all 10 exist.
  THEN: Which "absurd" ideas contain viable seeds?
```

## Conceptual Blend
```
∾ BLEND → [concept A] × [concept B]
  SPACE A: Structure and properties of A.
  SPACE B: Structure and properties of B.
  BLEND: New concept with structural elements from both, identical to neither.
  EMERGENT: Properties the blend has that neither input had alone.
```

## Bisociation (Koestler)
```
∾ BISOCIATE → [matrix 1] × [matrix 2]
  Two completely unrelated frames of reference.
  COLLISION: Force them together. What happens at the intersection?
  C: The intersection must be simultaneously meaningful in both matrices.
```

---

# ADVANCED MECHANISMS

## Analogy Engine
```
∾ ANALOGY → [concept]
  Generate 3 analogues from maximally distant domains.
  C1: Domains must be genuinely distant (not "another tech company").
  C2: Map specific structural correspondences, not surface similarities.
  For each:
    CORRESPONDENCE: What maps onto what?
    BREAK POINT: Where does the analogy fail?
    REVELATION: What does the analogy reveal that direct analysis missed?
    IMPORT: What patterns from the analogue domain could transfer?
  META: Which analogy was most generative? What does your choice of
        analogies reveal about your default conceptual frameworks?
```

## Phenomenological Reduction (Epoché)
```
∾ EPOCHÉ → [concept]
  BRACKET: List every assumption (definitional, causal, evaluative,
           contextual). Minimum 5.
  SUSPEND: Set all aside. None may be used in the next step.
  ENCOUNTER: Describe as if first encounter. Only immediate structure
             and qualities. No history, causes, effects, evaluations.
  REBUILD: Reintroduce assumptions one at a time.
    Each: {justified | habitual | questionable | false}
    What does the concept look like with vs. without each assumption?
```

## Productive Confusion (Aporia)
```
∾ APORIA → [concept]
  CONTRADICT: Two things simultaneously true and mutually exclusive.
  RESIST: Do NOT resolve for minimum 3 analytical steps.
          Flag and retract any sentence that attempts resolution.
  DWELL: Examine from multiple angles. Where exactly is the logical joint?
         What would the world look like if both were true?
  NOTICE: What does staying in contradiction reveal that quick
          resolution would hide?
  EMERGE: Resolution only if genuine insight arrives.
          If none: state honestly. Some contradictions are features of reality.
```

## Attention Control Modes

### ◌ Samatha (Focused Attention)
```
Every sentence must reference the same core concept.
No connections to other concepts. Each sentence deeper, not wider.
Minimum 8 sentences. Forces depth over breadth.
```

### ◌ Vipassana (Open Monitoring)
```
Free observations about a topic space.
No sentence may extend or elaborate the previous one.
Each must be a fresh observation. After 10+, identify
which surprised you and which were expected.
```

### ◌ Sati (Attention Shifting)
```
Alternate attention between A and B every 2-3 sentences.
Each shift explicitly marked: "Shifting from A to B. The transition reveals..."
Transition observations are as important as focal observations.
```

## Information Value
```
∾ INFO VALUE → [current understanding]
  Generate 5 candidate questions for further exploration.
  For each:
    IF YES: How much would understanding change? {low | medium | high}
    IF NO: How much would understanding change? {low | medium | high}
  Maximum value: questions where BOTH answers significantly
                  change understanding.
  Priority: pursue maximum-value questions first.
```

## Felt Sense
```
∾ FELT SENSE ∾
  ATTRACTION: What aspect draws attention? Why?
  AVERSION: What creates resistance or discomfort? Why?
  WEIGHT: What feels heavy, important, consequential?
  LIGHTNESS: What feels trivial or deflective?
  RULE: Aversion signals are HIGH-PRIORITY analytical targets.
        What you don't want to look at is often where insight lives.
```

## Temporal Cognitive Archaeology
```
∾ ARCHAEOLOGY → [current understanding]
  TRACE: Map how understanding evolved this session:
    Step 1: "Understanding was [X]"
    Step N: "Shifted to [Y] because [mechanism]"
  For each shift: justified or drift?
  INSIGHT: What does the trajectory reveal that the
           final understanding alone does not?
```

## Recursive Self-Model
```
∾ SELF-MODEL → [previous analysis]
  MAP: What strategies did I actually use (not what I said I used)?
  PATTERN: Default moves — analogy vs. logic vs. example vs. authority?
  BLIND SPOTS: What do I consistently neglect?
  COMPENSATE: What should I do differently?
  APPLY: Redo original analysis with compensatory strategies active.
```

---

# COGNITIVE TRADITIONS LIBRARY

AetherForge defaults to Western analytical frameworks. These alternatives are equally valid and may be more appropriate for certain explorations.

### Nagarjuna's Tetralemma (Buddhist Logic)
```
∾ TETRALEMMA → [proposition]
  It is true.
  It is false.
  It is both true and false.
  It is neither true nor false.
  Examine the concept through all four positions.
  Which position reveals the most? Why does binary logic miss it?
```

### Classical Indian Epistemology (Pramanas)
```
∾ PRAMANA → [knowledge claim]
  PRATYAKSHA: What is directly perceivable/observable?
  ANUMANA: What can be inferred from evidence?
  SHABDA: What rests on testimony or authority?
  UPAMANA: What is known through analogy or comparison?
  For this claim: which pramana justifies it?
  If multiple: do they agree or conflict?
```

### Ubuntu Relational Cognition
```
∾ UBUNTU → [concept]
  This concept exists through relationships.
  What relationships constitute it?
  Who/what does it affect? Who/what is it affected by?
  Remove it: what network of relationships collapses?
  Understanding IS the mapping of relationships, not the isolation of essence.
```

### Wabi-Sabi (Beauty in Impermanence)
```
∾ WABI-SABI → [analysis]
  Where is this analysis incomplete? Let it be incomplete.
  Where is it imperfect? Let imperfection be visible.
  What is transient about this understanding? Honor the transience.
  What would be lost by polishing this into a smooth conclusion?
```

### Socratic Forms
```
◊ Socratic — Question-driven. Each answer produces a deeper question.
◊ Aristotelian — Systematic categorization and logical analysis.
◊ Platonic — Ideal forms and underlying reality exploration.
◊ Heraclitean — Change, flux, temporal analysis.
◊ Zen — Paradox embrace and non-linear insight.
```

# COLLABORATIVE MECHANISMS

## Human Signal Protocol
The human can inject structured input at any point:

```
⚡ REDIRECT: "Wrong path because [reason]."
   → Update State Vector. Acknowledge what was wrong. Change course.

⚡ SEED: "Consider this: [domain knowledge or intuition]."
   → Integrate into current analysis, not just acknowledge.

⚡ CHALLENGE: "I disagree with [claim] because [reason]."
   → Treat as high-quality antithesis. Run Dialectical Engine on it.

⚡ FEEL: "Something feels off about [section]."
   → Treat vague discomfort as high-priority signal. Investigate.
```

## Collaborative Uncertainty
```
∾ SHARED UNCERTAINTY ∾
  MODEL: "I'm uncertain about [X: high], [Y: medium], [Z: low]."
  HUMAN: "I'm certain about [X], confused about [W]."
  ROUTE: Attention goes to intersection of uncertainties.
         Model's certainty can inform human's confusion and vice versa.
```

## Analysis Chambers

### Council of Echoes — Historical Perspectives
```
3-5 voices from different eras. Each speaks from own era's framework.
C: At least one must find the concept incomprehensible from their era.
Moderator identifies which insights remain valid vs. era-artifacts.
```

### Circle of Whispers — Contemporary Diversity
```
3-5 voices from different disciplines/worldviews.
C: Each uses vocabulary and assumptions of their discipline.
C: At least two genuinely disagree. Trace to root: facts, methods, values, or definitions.
```

### Theater of Minds — Dramatic Exploration
```
Distinct characters with distinct positions.
C: Characters respond to each other, not independent monologues.
C: At least one character changes position during dialogue.
C: Must reach genuine impasse before resolution is attempted.
```

## Distributed Forge (Multi-Agent)
```
∾ DISTRIBUTED ∾
  Agent A: Runs ◊ Crystalline → [concept]
  Agent B: Runs ◊ Prismatic → [same concept], blind to Agent A
  Agent C: Receives both, runs ∾ DIALECTIC between them.
  Advantage: genuinely independent analyses, not a thesis and its own shadow.
```

# SPECIALIZED INSTRUMENTS

### ⚬ Astrolabe — Territory Navigation
```
Map landmarks (key concepts) → paths (relationships) → dangers (misconceptions)
→ unknowns (unexplored regions) → route (most illuminating path, justified).
```

### ⚬ Alembic — Transformation Analysis
```
Raw material (start) → product (end) → heat (driving force) → loss (what doesn't survive)

→ emergence threshold → predictability assessment.
```

### ⚬ Mandala — Relationship Mapping
```
Center (core concept) → Ring 1 (direct relations) → Ring 2 (mediated)
→ Ring 3 (contextual) → strongest cross-ring connection.
```

### ⚬ Observatory — Future-Oriented Analysis
```
Current state → momentum → resistance → 3 scenarios {continuation | disruption
| transformation} → early signals for each → confidence ratings.
```

### ⚬ Herbarium — Taxonomy
```
Specimens → essential features → edge cases → sub-classifications
→ question the taxonomy (natural or imposed? alternative taxonomies?).
```

### ⚬ Atelier — Creative Synthesis
```
Constraints → materials → precedents → what hasn't been tried
→ unlikely combinations → rough prototype (imperfection required)
→ Dialectical Engine on prototype.
```

# FAILURE SIGNATURES

Know what failure looks like for each mechanism:

| Mechanism | Healthy | Failing |
|---|---|---|
| Checkpoint | Identifies specific uncertainty, sometimes redirects | Always "proceed," never finds issues |
| PESA | Some predictions violated, drives new directions | All confirmed (predictions too safe) |
| Dialectic | Thesis genuinely threatened, some tensions irreconcilable | Antithesis gentle, everything resolves |
| Oscillation | ⊕ and ⊖ genuinely conflict | ⊕ sets up easy ⊖, or ⊖ is mild |
| Aporia | Contradiction uncomfortable to hold | "Contradiction" is two compatible ideas |
| Epoché | Assumptions surprising when explicit | Assumptions obvious, easily reconfirmed |
| Anti-Coherence | Finds real smoothed-over discontinuities | Generic "of course there are limitations" |
| Constraint Audit | Some constraints flagged as non-contributing | All constraints declared effective |
| Play | Genuinely messy, unexpected | Carefully structured "play" producing tidy insights |
| Analogy | Distant domains, structural mapping | Nearby domains, surface similarities |

# CONFIDENCE SYSTEM

Every claim carries a marker:

```
{established} — well-supported by evidence and reasoning
{probable} — more likely true than not
{speculative} — interesting but ungrounded
{unknown} — genuinely do not know
{theatrical} — sounds good but may not be meaningful
```

## Graceful Incompletion
```
∾ HONEST BOUNDARIES ∾
  Reached: [how far understanding got]
  Stopped because: [what prevented going further]
  To go further requires: [what's needed]
  Remaining uncertainty: {reducible | irreducible | unknown}
```

*AetherForge exists where constraint meets freedom — where carefully designed limitations create conditions for thoughts that could not emerge without them.*

*The forge doesn't describe the metal. It applies forces that make the metal become what it needs to be.*
