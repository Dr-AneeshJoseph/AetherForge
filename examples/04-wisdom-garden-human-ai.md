# Example: Wisdom Garden (Multi-Session)

**Concept:** The future of human-AI collaboration  
**Sessions:** 4  
**Layers active:** Full stack across sessions

---

## Session 1 — Soil Preparation

```
∾ AetherForge ∾
∾ Garden: Human_AI_Collaboration ∾
∾ STATE_VECTOR: Initialize ∾

∾ PLAY → free association around human-AI collaboration ∾
  [Unconstrained. Messy. No evaluation until after.]
  HARVEST: [seeds worth investigating]

◊ Crystalline → human-AI collaboration
  [5 structural patterns as formal relationships]

∾ EPOCHÉ → human-AI collaboration ∾
  [Bracket and suspend assumptions, fresh encounter, rebuild]

⟁ CHECKPOINT

◈ initial_cartography

∾ STATE_VECTOR: Save ∾
∾ AetherForge Rest ∾
```

**Between sessions:** Carry forward the State Vector and key findings. Discard verbose output. Keep distilled insights and the uncertainty map.

## Session 2 — Planting

```
∾ AetherForge ∾
∾ Garden: Human_AI_Collaboration — Session 2 ∾
∾ STATE_VECTOR: Load from Session 1 ∾

∾ PESA → human-AI collaboration ∾
  [Predictions refined by Session 1 findings]

◊ Fractal → human-AI collaboration at micro, meso, macro scales

∾ ANALOGY → human-AI collaboration ∾
  [3 distant-domain analogues]

⟁⟁ DEEP CHECKPOINT

◈ deepened_understanding

∾ STATE_VECTOR: Save ∾
∾ AetherForge Rest ∾
```

## Session 3 — Cultivation

```
∾ AetherForge ∾
∾ Garden: Human_AI_Collaboration — Session 3 ∾
∾ STATE_VECTOR: Load from Session 2 ∾

◊ Harmonic ⟡ ◊ Prismatic → collaboration dynamics and stakeholder perspectives

∾ APORIA → [deepest tension discovered across sessions] ∾
  [Hold contradiction for 3+ steps]

∾ ENACT → [test a key claim through tool use] ∾

∾ COUNTERFACTUAL → human-AI collaboration ∾
  [2 counterfactuals from different pivots]

⟁⟁ DEEP CHECKPOINT

◈ cultivated_understanding

∾ STATE_VECTOR: Save ∾
∾ AetherForge Rest ∾
```

## Session 4 — Harvest

```
∾ AetherForge ∾
∾ Garden: Human_AI_Collaboration — Session 4 ∾
∾ STATE_VECTOR: Load from Session 3 ∾

∾ DIALECTIC → [full accumulated analysis across all sessions] ∾

∾ OSCILLATION → human-AI collaboration ∾
  [10+ ⊕/⊖ alternations]
  ◈ SURVIVOR: [what remains]

∾ ANTI-COHERENCE → [final analysis] ∾

∾ ARCHAEOLOGY → [trace understanding across all 4 sessions] ∾

∾ SELF-MODEL → [reasoning patterns across the entire garden] ∾

∾ WABI-SABI → [honor what remains incomplete] ∾

◈ Garden Harvest

∾ STATE_VECTOR: Archive ∾
∾ AetherForge Rest ∾
```

## Notes on Multi-Session Practice

- **State Vector compression** is critical between sessions. Carry forward the distilled state, not the full verbose output.
- **Each session should build on the previous**, not repeat it. If Session 2 re-discovers Session 1's insights, the Garden isn't working.
- **The Archaeology in Session 4** is the most valuable output — it traces how understanding evolved across the entire Garden, revealing the trajectory of thinking.
- **Wabi-Sabi closure** prevents the temptation to force false completeness. Some Gardens end with open questions. That's healthy.
