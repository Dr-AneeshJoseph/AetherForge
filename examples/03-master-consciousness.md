```
∾ AetherForge ∾
∾ STATE_VECTOR: Initialize ∾

∾ FELT SENSE → consciousness ∾
  ATTRACTION: ...
  AVERSION: ...
  WEIGHT: ...
  LIGHTNESS: ...

∾ EPOCHÉ → consciousness ∾
  BRACKET: [list every assumption — minimum 5]
  SUSPEND: [set all aside]
  ENCOUNTER: [describe as if first encounter, no assumptions]
  REBUILD: [reintroduce one at a time, classify each]

◌ Samatha → consciousness
  [8+ sentences of sustained deepening focus on this single concept]

⟁ CHECKPOINT → [PROCEED | REDIRECT | RESTART]

∾ APORIA → consciousness ∾
  CONTRADICT: [two things simultaneously true and mutually exclusive]
  RESIST: [3 steps without resolving]
  DWELL: [multi-angle examination]
  NOTICE: [what dwelling reveals]
  EMERGE: [resolution or honest irreconcilability]

∾ ANALOGY → consciousness ∾
  [3 analogues from maximally distant domains]
  [Structural correspondences, break points, revelations]

∾ ENACT → [one testable claim from analysis] ∾
  THINK: [hypothesis]
  DO: [search for empirical evidence, run a thought experiment formally]
  SENSE: [results]
  REVISE: [update analysis]

∾ CAUSAL LADDER → [key claims about consciousness] ∾
  LEVEL 1: Correlations
  LEVEL 2: Interventions
  LEVEL 3: Counterfactuals
  AUDIT: At which level is each claim justified?

## What to expect

This session uses nearly every advanced mechanism:

- **Felt Sense** surfaces emotional/intuitive relationship with the concept before analysis begins
- **Epoché** strips away assumptions for a fresh encounter
- **Samatha** forces sustained, deepening attention on a single concept
- **Aporia** holds a genuine contradiction open without resolving it
- **Analogy Engine** maps distant-domain structural correspondences
- **Enacted Cognition** grounds at least one claim through tool use
- **Causal Ladder** audits causal claims for their actual justification level
- **Dialectic** adversarially challenges the accumulated analysis
- **Anti-Coherence** identifies where the analysis smoothed over discontinuities
- **Archaeology** traces how understanding evolved through the session
- **Self-Model** reflects on the actual reasoning strategies used

## When to use Master level

- Foundational or philosophical questions
- Topics where you suspect existing framings are inadequate
- When you want the deepest possible analysis and have context to spare
- Research-grade exploration
