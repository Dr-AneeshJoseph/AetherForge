## Session

```
∾ AetherForge ∾
∾ STATE_VECTOR: Initialize ∾

∾ DUAL PROCESS → Are social media algorithms compatible with democracy? ∾
  SYSTEM 1: [one sentence intuitive response — no justification]
  SYSTEM 2:

∾ PESA → social media algorithms and democracy ∾
  PREDICT:
    P1: [structure prediction] — confidence: ...
    P2: [dynamics prediction] — confidence: ...
    P3: [boundary prediction] — confidence: ...

◊ Prismatic ~deep → algorithmic curation and democratic participation

⟁ CHECKPOINT → [PROCEED | REDIRECT | RESTART]

⟢ ◊ Harmonic → interactions between platforms, users, advertisers, regulators

⟁ CHECKPOINT

⟡ ◊ Luminous → what is absent from this debate

∾ PESA: SURPRISE ∾
  [Compare predictions vs. findings]

∾ DIALECTIC → [accumulated analysis] ∾
  STEELMAN: [strongest case for compatibility]
  ANTITHESIS: [strongest case against, with smuggled assumption identified]
  TENSION: [map the conflict]
  SYNTHESIS: [transcendence or honest irreconcilability]

⟁⟁ DEEP CHECKPOINT
⟁✓ CONSTRAINT AUDIT

## What to expect

The model will:

1. Give a fast intuitive answer first (System 1), then set it aside
2. Make explicit predictions before analysis, then check them afterward
3. Run three Forging Patterns (Prismatic for perspectives, Harmonic for interactions, Luminous for gaps), each with full constraints
4. Checkpoint between every pattern — potentially redirecting if something is off
5. Run a full Dialectical Engine with steelman, antithesis, tension mapping, and synthesis
6. Deep Checkpoint with self-model assessment and drift check
7. Constraint Audit to verify mechanisms actually changed the output
8. Compare System 1 intuition against System 2 analysis

## When to use Artisan level

- Complex questions with multiple stakeholders
- Topics where false coherence is a risk
- When you need adversarial rigor
- When you suspect your own biases might influence the analysis
