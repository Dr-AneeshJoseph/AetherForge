# Example: Apprentice Level Session

**Concept:** The nature of trust in digital systems  
**Layers active:** Layer 1 (Constraint Engine) + basic Layer 2 (Checkpoint)  
**Estimated tokens:** Low

---

## Session

```
∾ AetherForge ∾

◊ Crystalline ~gentle → trust in digital systems

⟁ CHECKPOINT

◈ foundational_understanding

∾ AetherForge Rest ∾
```

## What to expect

The model will:

1. Generate 4 structural patterns about digital trust as formal relationships before any interpretation (e.g., "Trust → Verification: trust in digital systems requires externalized verification mechanisms that physical trust does not")
2. Identify tensions between those patterns
3. Only then interpret, grounding each insight in specific patterns
4. At the checkpoint, identify its greatest uncertainty and whether it's reasoning or pattern-matching
5. Synthesize

## When to use Apprentice level

- You're learning AetherForge
- The question is straightforward
- You want structured analysis without heavy overhead
- Context window is limited
