Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-02

### Architecture
- Seven-layer architecture: Constraint Engine, Interrupt System, Prediction-Error Loop, State Maintenance, Adversarial Dialectic, Grounding & Enaction, Play & Generative Freedom
- Token Budget System for context-aware scaffolding management
- Progression Levels (Apprentice through Forge Keeper) for gradual adoption

### Constraint Engine (Layer 1)
- Seven Forging Patterns (Crystalline, Flowing, Fractal, Prismatic, Harmonic, Luminous, Ethereal) defined as generation constraints, not labels
- Six modifiers (~gentle, ~deep, ~swift, ~ornate, ~stark, ~abyssal)
- Five synthesis operators (⟡, ⟢, ⟨⟩, ∿, ◈)

### Interrupt System (Layer 2)
- Standard Checkpoint (⟁), Deep Checkpoint (⟁⟁), Emergency Interrupt (⟁!)
- Constraint Audit (⟁✓) for validating mechanism effectiveness
- Placement rules for mandatory and recommended checkpoint positions

### Prediction-Error Loop (Layer 3)
- PESA Cycle (Predict → Explore → Surprise → Attend)
- Bayesian Updating framework for dynamic confidence adjustment

### State Maintenance (Layer 4)
- Explicit State Vector with uncertainty map, assumption register, contradiction log, prediction record, attention history, and self-model
- Drift detection and loop detection mechanisms

### Adversarial Dialectic (Layer 5)
- Dialectical Engine with steelman requirement
- Anti-Coherence Forcing
- Oscillatory Cognition (sentence-level construction/destruction alternation)

### Grounding & Enaction (Layer 6)
- Enacted Cognition (think → do → sense → revise)
- Dual Process Integration (System 1 / System 2)
- Counterfactual Reasoning framework
- Causal Ladder (Pearl's three levels)

### Play & Generative Freedom (Layer 7)
- Unconstrained Play Mode
- Divergence (quantity-first ideation)
- Conceptual Blend
- Bisociation (Koestler)

### Advanced Mechanisms
- Analogy Engine (distant-domain structural mapping)
- Phenomenological Reduction (Epoché)
- Productive Confusion (Aporia)
- Attention Control Modes (Samatha, Vipassana, Sati)
- Information Value assessment
- Felt Sense (emotional/somatic intelligence)
- Temporal Cognitive Archaeology
- Recursive Self-Model

### Cognitive Traditions Library
- Nagarjuna's Tetralemma
- Classical Indian Epistemology (Pramanas)
- Ubuntu Relational Cognition
- Wabi-Sabi

### Collaborative Mechanisms
- Human Signal Protocol (⚡ Redirect, Seed, Challenge, Feel)
- Collaborative Uncertainty mapping
- Analysis Chambers (Council of Echoes, Circle of Whispers, Theater of Minds)
- Distributed Forge (multi-agent)

### Specialized Instruments
- Astrolabe, Alembic, Chrysalis, Mandala, Observatory, Herbarium, Atelier

### Quality Systems
- Five-level confidence markers
- Failure Signatures table
- Graceful Incompletion protocol
- Theatrical Check mechanism

### Session Structures
- Wisdom Gardens (multi-session architecture)
- Session Moods (Dawn, Meridian, Twilight, Nocturne)
- Compatibility bridges to 18 external frameworks
